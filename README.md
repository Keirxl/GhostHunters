**Intro:**
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The haunted house up the street has been more active than normal...  
A small child with a ragged nightgown and long black hair dares you to explore the house.  
You find nothing suspicious about this, so you and some friends agree to go exploring.  
The small child gestures to a box you were sure wasn't there a minute ago...  
Inside you find gadgets that appear to some sort of modified flashlight and off you go into the house!  

As soon as you step inside you feel a chill down your spine... this house is certainly demonically infested.  
As you prepare to use these strange gadgets to fight for your life and to contain this evil a thought crosses your mind...
