# GhostHunters
A cooperative game for Blinks  

Ghosts and Ghouls are trying to haunt your mansion!  
You and a friend must use your flashlight to dissapate the ghosts, and your lasers to zap the ghouls!  
You only have to survive long enough for their haunting to pass to another house. 

  
- For two Players(or one ambitious player)  
- when you load the game, it will be in the win phase. Take this time to separate two blinks 
And long hold them both. They will turn into flashlights (yellow). Then long press one to be a laser(blue) 
- one person gets the flashlight, one the laser 
- when you triple click it will begin the one minute survival
- ghosts (white) and ghouls(red) will randomly pop up in your haunted mansion 
- sometimes a goblin (green) will pop up as well 
- if any ghost or ghoul is not zapped or dissapated fast enough, your mansion will become haunted and you lose  
- Lasers zap ghouls, while flashlights dissapate ghosts. Goblins must be both hit with a flashlight and a Lazer at the same time
- during gameplay you must keep all blinks flat on the table.  
- survive until the haunting moves down the block to try another house!  
- triple click at any point to reset the game
